Overview:
A decentralized chat application is an approach to communication that leverages that leverage blockchain and peer-to-peer (P2P) technology to enable secure and private messaging without relying on centralized servers.

Features:
- Decentralized Communication: All messages are stored on the blockchain, ensuring tamper-proof and transparent communication.
- Secure and Private: Messages are encrypted and only accessible to the intended participants.
- User-Friendly Interface: A clean and intuitive UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Smart Contract Integration: Chat functionalities are powered by Solidity smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain (or other compatible networks).
- Wallet Integration: Supports Ethereum wallets like MetaMask for user authentication and transactions.

Technology Stack:

- Programming Languages:
> JavaScript (React.js): Used for building the frontend of the chat application.
> Solidity: Used for writing smart contacts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.
> HTML/CSS: Used for structuring and styling the user interface of the application.

- Blockchain Technology:
 > Ethereum: Utilized for deploying smart contacts that handle user authentication, message encryption, and decentralized storage of the message data.

- Encryption and Security:
> Web.js: For interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and handling cryptographic operations related to smart contacts.

- Testing Tools:
> Hardhat: Used for testing smart contacts and deploying them to the Ethereum blockchain.

- Operating System:
The project is developed to be compatible with various operating system, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Installation and Setup:
- Clone the repository
https://github.com/kashyapeeshika/ver3
